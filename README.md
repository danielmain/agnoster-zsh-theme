# btg.zsh-theme

This is a Fork of the original [Agnoster ZSH Theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)

This theme is optimized for people who want to see the current Bitcoin Gold USD Price and who use:

- Solarized
- Git
- Unicode-compatible fonts and terminals (I use iTerm2 + Menlo)

For Mac users, I highly recommend iTerm 2 + Solarized Dark

# Compatibility

**NOTE:** In all likelihood, you will need to install a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) for this theme to render correctly.

## What does it show?

- If the previous command failed (✘)
- User @ Hostname (if user is not DEFAULT_USER, which can then be set in your profile)
- Bitcoin Gold USD Price from www.coinmarketcap.com
- Git status
  - Branch () or detached head (➦)
  - Current branch / SHA1 in detached head state
  - Dirty working directory (±, color change)
- Working directory
- Elevated (root) privileges (⚡)
